There are two sorted array nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.                                                      
Find the median of two sorted arrays with run time complexcity of O(log(m+n)).                                         

    Example 1:                  
      nums1 = [1, 3]                    
      nums2 = [2]                   
      The median is 2.0                   
                
    Example 2:                    
      nums1 = [1, 2]                    
      nums2 = [3, 4]                          
      The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5                 

Solution:

Normally, we need to consider the length of a sorted array in order to find its median. This comes two cases for us to consider. Is there a way that we can get the same result without consider the length of a given array? 
Yes, there is. The idea is came from combination and permutation, and it also demonstrated by "Stellari" in github. That is, we insert "#" between each two numbers in array and also before and after the array, and see "#" and numbers are all positions. This this way, there are always (2 * N + 1) positions regardless of lengh of array, N.

    For example:                        
    [6 9 13 18] -> [# 6 # 9 # 13 # 18 #]                (N = 4), (position = 9 = 2 * N + 1)             
    [6 9 11 13 18] -> [# 6 # 9 # 11 # 13 # 18 #]        (N = 5), (position = 11 = 2 * N + 1)                
    
With this in mind, let's see how to cut two sorted arrays in order to find median.              
There are 2N+1 positions in one array, so 2N + 2N + 2 positions for two arrays. Despide the two position of cut, there are exactly N + N positions on each side of the cut. If we cut at position C2 = k in array2, then the cut position in array1 C1 is N1 + N2 - k.                      
Let L be the number immediatrly left to the cut in array A, and R be the right counterpart. We observe the index of L and R have the following relationship with the length of the array N:                     

        N       Index of L / R
        1               0 / 0
        2               0 / 1
        3               1 / 1
        4               1 / 2
        5               2 / 2
        6               2 / 3
        7               3 / 3
        8               3 / 4
        9               4 / 4
        
It's not hard to conclude that index of L = (N-1)/2, and R = N/2.                           
So the median is (L + R) / 2 = ( A[(N-1)/2] + A[N/2] ) / 2.                     
In the case of two arrays:                              

    L1 = A1[(C1 - 1) / 2];    R1 = A1[C1 / 2];
    L2 = A2[(C2 - 1) / 2];    R2 = A2[C2 / 2];
    
To make sure that the cut is what we wanted, we only need                       

    L1 <= R1   &&   L1 <= R2   &&   L2 <= R1   &&   L2 <= R2
    
Since the two arrays are sorted, L1 <= R1   &&   L2 <= R2 are natually guaranteed. We only need to make sure:                 

    L1 <= R2   &&   L2 <= R1.
    
Two side notes:

    1.  Select the shorter array to move the cut postion can make the run-time complexity be O(log(min(n+m))), since the two
    cut position are mutually determined from each other.
    2.  The only edge case is when a cut is ont the head position or tail position. We simply imagine that both arrays have
    two extra positions, INT_MAX at A[-1] and A[N]. These addition don't change the result, but make the implementation
    easier.
    
Now let's see the implementation:

    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) 
    {
        int N1 = nums1.size();
        int N2 = nums2.size();
        if (N1 < N2) 
            return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);	// Make sure A2 is the shorter one.
    
        if (N2 == 0) 
            return ((double)nums1[(N1-1)/2] + (double)nums1[N1/2])/2;  // If A2 is empty
    
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = N2 * 2;
        while (lo <= hi) 
        {
            int mid2 = (lo + hi) / 2;   // Try Cut 2 
            int mid1 = N1 + N2 - mid2;  // Calculate Cut 1 accordingly
        
            double L1 = (mid1 == 0) ? INT_MIN : nums1[(mid1-1)/2];	// Get L1, R1, L2, R2 respectively
            double L2 = (mid2 == 0) ? INT_MIN : nums2[(mid2-1)/2];
            double R1 = (mid1 == N1 * 2) ? INT_MAX : nums1[(mid1)/2];
            double R2 = (mid2 == N2 * 2) ? INT_MAX : nums2[(mid2)/2];
        
            if (L1 > R2) 
                lo = mid2 + 1;		// A1's lower half is too big; need to move C1 left (C2 right)
            else if (L2 > R1) 
                hi = mid2 - 1;	// A2's lower half too big; need to move C2 left.
            else 
                return (max(L1,L2) + min(R1, R2)) / 2;	// Otherwise, that's the right cut.
        }
        return -1;
    } 
    
Time Complexcity:   O(log(m+n))
