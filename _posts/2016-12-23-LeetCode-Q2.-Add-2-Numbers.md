You are given two linked list representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.                          
Example:                                                   
input:     (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)                                                         
output:  (7 -> 0 -> 8)

Solution:                          

Be caution that this linked-list-representation is actually the addition: 342 + 465 = 807, instead of 243 + 564 = 807, since the digits are stored in reverse order. In order to make this addition clearer, let's start to see an example with a different number, so that the result will be different if one used wrong summing order. (I did wrong at first time!)          
EX: (2->4->6) + (5->6->7), the sum is actually 642 + 765 = 1417, instead of 246 + 567 = 813.
	   
	    (6 <- 4 <- 2) 
          + (7 <- 6 <- 5)
          -----------------
            13   10    7
          -----------------
            14     0     7
Just like how you add two numbers on paper, we start summing from right towards left, and we put carries into one-left to the
current digit. So, the summing result should be [7,0,4,1], instead of [1,4,0,7].

Let's see how to implement this process.    

        ListNode *addTwoNumbers(ListNode *l1, ListNode *l2) 
        {
            ListNode head(-1); // head node
            int carry = 0;
            ListNode *prev = &head;
            for (ListNode *a = l1, *b = l2; a != nullptr || b != nullptr; a = (a == nullptr) ? nullptr : a->next,
                                                                          b = (b == nullptr) ? nullptr : b->next,
                                                                              prev = prev->next) 
            {
                const int a_val = (a == nullptr) ? 0 : a->val;
                const int b_val = (b == nullptr) ? 0 : b->val;
                const int value = (a_val + b_val + carry) % 10;
                carry = (a_val + b_val + carry) / 10;
                prev->next = new ListNode(value); // insert at end
            }
            if (carry > 0)
                prev->next = new ListNode(carry);
            return head.next;
        }
