Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specifi target.
You may assume that each imput would have exactly one solution.

Example:                                                                                                  
Given nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0,1].
