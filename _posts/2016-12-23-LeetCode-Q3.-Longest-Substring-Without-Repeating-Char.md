Given a string, find the length of the longest subtring without reapeating characters.
Example:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", which the length is 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", which the length is 3.

Now let start to look at this problem.
In order to find the longest substring, we nee
