Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:                                           
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,                                      
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,                                          
return [0, 1].

Solutions:                                                   
First mind twist is how we track numbers as tranversed. Since we need to find any two numbers in the given array that their sum is equal to the target number, we can subtract each entry of given array from target, and compare the result with aother entries to see if it exist. Second, we use a hash-table to tranverse the array as less time as possible (i.e, one-pass).
With these two idea in mind, let's approach to the implementation.           
//
class Solution
{
    public:
          vector<int> twoSum (vector<int>&nums, int target)
          {
              map<int, int> my_map;
              map<int, int>::iterator iter;
              vector<int> result;
              
              // use entries of nums as index of map
              // use index of nums as entries of map
              for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
              {
                 my_map [ nums[i] ] = i;
              }
              for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++ )
              {
                 auto iter = my_map.find(target - nums[i]);
                  if(iter != my_map.end()  &&  iter->second > i)
                  {
                      result.push_back(i+1);
                      result.push_back(iter->second + 1);
                      break;
                  }
              }
          
              return result;
           }// end of public funtion
}
