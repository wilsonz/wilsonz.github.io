title: "LeetCode Q3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
time: 2016-12-23

Given a string, find the length of the longest subtring without reapeating characters.
Example:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", which the length is 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", which the length is 3.
Note that "pwke" is a subsequence, and it is not a substring.

Solution:

I found that if there's situations that ask for number of designated entries in a string or an array,
we can use map to store the index of string/array as entries, and the entries of string/array as index/key
of the map.
Now let start to look at this problem.
In order to find the longest substring, we need to scan the string. 
If we find there's a char that we met before, we start a new scan from the next position of the char we first met, 
until the end position.
We use another array to keep track the position of a char that we first met. Because 0 is valid position, we first
fill up this tracking array with -1. 

int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) 
{
    const int ASCII_MAX = 255;
    int last[ASCII_MAX]; // position the char we met first time
    int start = 0; // current position
    fill(last, last + ASCII_MAX, -1); // initial -1, since 0 is valid position
    int max_len = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) 
    {
        if (last[s[i]] >= start) 
        {
            max_len = max(i - start, max_len);
            start = last[s[i]] + 1;
        }
        last[s[i]] = i;
    }
    return max((int)s.size() - start, max_len); // don't forget last time
}
