There are two sorted array nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.                                
Find the median of two sorted arrays with run time complexcity of O(log(m+n)).              
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
The median is 2.0

Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
